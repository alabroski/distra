# Distra
A simple distributed database system for educational purposes

### What is Distra?

Distra is a simple distributed database system that I created for personal educational purposes.
The system has 3 parts:
* A (very) simple database system that works with an even simpler transaction query language.
* A middleware layer which acts as a transaction coordinator.
* A simple client that connects to the system through a middleware layer endpoint.
